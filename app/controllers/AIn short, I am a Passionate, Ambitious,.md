AIn short, I am a Passionate, Ambitious, and practical Software Engineer. I was introduced to web development at 16 years of age by a  neighbor. Since then I have enjoyed the journey
which began by printing hello world on my first web page to the last sentence of my portfolio as a full stack web developer, the journey still continues each day as I continue to improve and 
learn more soft skills and techniques.

I have invested time, effort, and resources in learning and mastering the following technologies:
- Programming languages: JavaScript, Ruby
- Databases: SQLite, SQL, PostgreSQL
- Frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap
- Testing: Rspec, Minitest

In an effort to write quality and yet elegant code I have combined time, resources, and  efforts together to learn and apply the following techniques to my work:
- Test-Driven Development(TDD) strategy
- Model View Controller (MVC) Design pattern
- Version control using Git

I am also a contributor to open-source projects on GitHub (https://github.com/brolinr/) and GitLab (https://gitlab.com/brolinr). The above-mentioned GitHub and GitLab accounts do not only contain my open source contributions but also contain my project repositories.
