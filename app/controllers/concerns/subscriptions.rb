#WE NEED A METHOD TO CHECK FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION EXIPRATION
#
#def expired
#    created = customer.subscription.last.created_at
#    if created >= created + 30#days from now
        #then we are still good
#    else
        #create new subscription
#    end
#end


#def subscribed?
    
#    if customer.subscriptions.any? && expiry > current_date 
        #expiry = customer.Subscription.last.created_at + 30 days 
        #current_date = customer.Subscription.last.created_at

        #then user is subscribed
#    else
        
#    end
